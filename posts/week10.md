# Self reflection questions

**Assignment 01**

• How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of
your edit?
  I approached the relationship between the sonic and visual components by ensuring that the sounds complemented and enhanced the visuals, creating a cohesive emotional experience. For example, I used ambient sounds like heartbeats and equipment beeping to signify life and its fleeting nature, aligning with visual transitions between life and death.

• How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?

The footage was selected based on its ability to convey the emotional journey and theme of the project. I looked for symbolic and visually striking elements, such as the dragonfly, which represents transformation and the transition between life stages.

• What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how did you apply this knowledge to your project?

I learned that sound profoundly influences emotional perception. Background music was chosen to be soft and ethereal, creating an atmosphere of nostalgia and introspection. Sound transitions were carefully timed to guide the audience's emotional response, using L and J cuts to create seamless audio-visual shifts.


• How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use these concepts to shape your use of time in the project?

Editing was crucial in establishing pacing and rhythm. By using match cuts and quick cuts, I maintained a fluid narrative flow that mirrored the protagonist's fragmented perception. This method helped control the timing and emotional build-up throughout the video.

• Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to
depict in your portrait?

I depicted parts of my personality and interests, such as a fascination with the ephemeral nature of life and transformation. The choice of the dragonfly symbol reflects my interest in natural cycles and the interconnectedness of existence.

• What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your
work?

Aesthetic choices included the use of cold tones to evoke detachment and otherworldliness, and seamless transitions to blur the lines between different states of consciousness. These choices were intended to immerse the audience in a dreamlike experience, reflecting on life's transient nature.

In reflecting on the project, the integration of sonic and visual elements was pivotal. The ambient sounds, such as heartbeats and equipment beeping, were meticulously synchronized with visual transitions, crafting a cohesive and emotionally resonant experience. This approach ensured that the auditory elements enhanced the narrative, making the themes of life and death more poignant and immersive. The footage selection process was equally deliberate, aiming to effectively convey the emotional journey. Symbolic elements like the dragonfly were chosen for their visual impact and thematic relevance, with iterative refinements ensuring alignment with the project's narrative and aesthetic goals.

The project underscored the power of sound in shaping emotional experiences. Background music and ambient sounds were chosen to evoke feelings of nostalgia and introspection. Techniques like L and J cuts facilitated seamless audio-visual transitions, heightening the viewer's emotional engagement. Through this project, the intricate interplay between sound and visual components was explored, demonstrating how carefully curated audio elements can amplify the emotional depth of visual storytelling.

The suite of icons was conceived with the theme of "Memory" in mind, targeting users passionate about documenting their lives. This theme was selected to resonate with individuals who keep diaries or film family moments, aiming to evoke a sense of nostalgia and personal history. The design process involved multiple iterations, starting with thumbnail sketches and evolving through feedback and refinement. Each iteration aimed to improve clarity and visual appeal, ensuring the final icons were functional and aesthetically pleasing.

Color played a crucial role in creating a unified and visually appealing icon set. A palette of light blue, red, and yellow was chosen for its vibrancy and ability to convey the theme of memory. This color scheme added depth and made the icons more engaging, enhancing the user experience. The project highlighted the importance of iterative design and the thoughtful use of color to create a cohesive and meaningful user interface.


**Assignment03**

Creating a working prototype was essential for identifying and resolving practical issues that theoretical planning could not foresee. It allowed for iterative testing and adjustments, such as fixing navigation problems and collider meshes, ensuring a smoother user experience. This hands-on approach was instrumental in refining the design and functionality of the project.

Designing a 3D environment required different considerations compared to 2D media. The 3D project demanded a focus on spatial awareness, depth, and user interaction, whereas 2D design primarily dealt with layout and visual balance. This shift in focus was both challenging and enriching, offering a broader perspective on design principles. The virtual camera played a pivotal role in guiding the user's perspective and enhancing immersion. Unlike in previous assignments where the camera captured specific angles, the virtual camera in the 3D environment allowed for dynamic exploration, providing a more interactive and engaging experience.

Sound was used to create atmosphere and emotional depth, similar to previous assignments but adapted for a 3D environment. Background music was chosen to evoke a sense of order and immersion, while ambient sounds like birds singing were used sparingly to maintain a peaceful atmosphere. This approach differed from earlier projects where sound was more directly tied to visual transitions. The theme of "Life and Death" guided the design, evolving from initial sketches to a more refined concept that balanced fantasy and realism. Play testing uncovered issues that were not apparent during the design phase, such as navigation problems and model collisions, highlighting the importance of user feedback in the iterative design process.



## Statement Writing

"Life and Death: A Reflective Journey" is a multimedia project that employs video and sound to explore the profound themes of existence. Drawing inspiration from personal experiences and the symbolism of the dragonfly, this work delves into transformation and the cyclical nature of life. By meticulously synchronizing ambient sounds with visual elements, the project evokes a deep emotional response, guiding viewers through a contemplative and introspective narrative journey.

"Memory Icons: A Visual Representation" is a suite of digital icons created for an iPhone application. Inspired by the theme of memory, the design process involved multiple iterations, refining the clarity and appeal of each icon. These icons aim to enhance the user experience by evoking nostalgia and personal history through vibrant colors and familiar symbols. The final designs successfully translate abstract concepts into concrete visual elements, providing a cohesive and engaging interface for users to document their memories.

"Life and Death: A 3D Virtual Environment" is an interactive project that immerses users in a reflective journey through a three-dimensional space. Influenced by games like "NieR: Automata," the environment balances realism and fantasy to explore themes of grief and the passage of time. The project utilizes spatial design, dynamic camera angles, and ambient soundscapes to create an emotionally engaging experience, unifying various elements under a cohesive theme that evolved during development. Play testing revealed insights that further refined the project's impact.
