## Iterations of wirframes

In the week10 work, I already got my first wireframes design  by using Procrate.

And for the further design develop, I chose to use wireframe.cc to continue my work.

**Home page**

In the first iteration, I planing to insert a extra photo as a menu page behind the titles which is  normal placing plan for webpage.

But when I trying to put my design into Figma, I found out it's hard to build a 70's style, the main style of this website. The photo I want colour should be bright and have textures, But There's no suitable photo I can find  to put in it. 

Home page is a key point to decide the whole style of website, So In the second iteration, I deleted the photo. And choose a round font with thick strokes with the grey hue, let the style coming back. 

**statement**

In this step, this page already closed to the final result.

Different with the design in week10, this time i put all three project statements in the same section, instead of put every thing into three parrs which each need a whole page.

**aboutme page**

This page is not the important part of the project, the reason why it is here, is to fill the empty in the menu fection,
