# Self reflection questions

**Assignment 01**

• How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of your edit?
  
  I approached the relationship between the sonic and visual components by ensuring that the sounds complemented and enhanced the visuals, creating a cohesive emotional experience. For example, I used ambient sounds like heartbeats and equipment beeping to signify life and its fleeting nature, aligning with visual transitions between life and death.

• How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?

  The footage was selected based on its ability to convey the emotional journey and theme of the project. I looked for symbolic and visually striking elements, such as the dragonfly, which represents transformation and the transition between life stages.

• What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how did you apply this knowledge to your project?

  I learned that sound profoundly influences emotional perception. Background music was chosen to be soft and ethereal, creating an atmosphere of nostalgia and introspection. Sound transitions were carefully timed to guide the audience's emotional response, using L and J cuts to create seamless audio-visual shifts.


• How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use these concepts to shape your use of time in the project?

  Editing was crucial in establishing pacing and rhythm. By using match cuts and quick cuts, I maintained a fluid narrative flow that mirrored the protagonist's fragmented perception. This method helped control the timing and emotional build-up throughout the video.

• Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to
depict in your portrait?

  I depicted parts of my personality and interests, such as a fascination with the ephemeral nature of life and transformation. The choice of the dragonfly symbol reflects my interest in natural cycles and the interconnectedness of existence.

• What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your
work?

  Aesthetic choices included the use of cold tones to evoke detachment and otherworldliness, and seamless transitions to blur the lines between different states of consciousness. These choices were intended to immerse the audience in a dreamlike experience, reflecting on life's transient nature.

• How would you summarise your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose the theme that you did?

The idea behind the suite of icons was to create visual elements for an iPhone application designed to help users record and review their lives, specifically targeting people passionate about documenting their memories. The theme of "Memory" was chosen to resonate with users who enjoy keeping diaries or filming family moments, aiming to evoke nostalgia and a sense of personal history 

• Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed across those iterations, and why did you choose the one that you ended up with?

Initially, multiple concepts were explored through thumbnail sketches. The iterations involved experimenting with different designs and refining them based on their effectiveness and simplicity. For instance, icons representing security, audio recording, and photo albums were repeatedly revised to balance clarity and visual appeal. The final choices were made to ensure the icons were easily recognisable and thematically cohesive.  

• How did you translate your thumbnail sketches into the final flat designs in Illustrator? Was anything lost in that translation, or gained?

The transition from thumbnail sketches to final flat designs in Illustrator involved distilling shapes and using high-contrast colors to maintain clarity. While some details were simplified or omitted to avoid clutter, the essence of the original sketches was preserved. The use of Adobe Illustrator's tools facilitated this process, helping to create clean, scalable designs that remained true to the initial concepts  

• How did you use colour to create a sense of unity and visual interest in the icons? Why did you choose the palette that you did?

Color was crucial in creating unity and visual interest. A palette of light blue, red, and yellow was chosen to evoke a sense of passion and vibrancy, aligning with the application's theme. The use of three hues in each icon added depth and made the designs more engaging without overwhelming the viewer​.

• How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design?

In both audio and visual design, elements such as contrast, balance, and emphasis were key. Just as sound was used to evoke emotions and guide the viewer's experience, visual elements were carefully designed to draw attention and convey meaning. The interplay of these principles ensured that both the audio and visual components complemented each other, enhancing the overall user experience​ 

• How did you translate the prompt that you chose from an abstract idea to a set of concrete visual designs?

The abstract idea of "Memory" was translated into concrete visual designs by focusing on everyday objects and symbols associated with recording and recalling memories, such as locks, cameras, and maps. These symbols were chosen for their familiarity and ability to evoke a sense of security, nostalgia, and exploration, effectively bridging the gap between abstract concepts and tangible icons 


**Assignment03**

• How important was a working prototype to your design process? What did it offer that process?

The working prototype was vital for identifying and resolving practical issues that theoretical planning could not foresee. It allowed for iterative testing and adjustments, such as fixing navigation problems and collider meshes, ensuring a smoother user experience.​ 

• How did your experience of designing and producing a three-dimensional environment differ from your experience of designing and producing a project in two-dimensional media?

Designing a 3D environment differed significantly from 2D projects in terms of spatial awareness and interaction. In 3D, considerations like depth, perspective, and user navigation became vital, whereas 2D design primarily focused on layout and visual balance on a flat plane. The 3D environment required more complex modelling and texture mapping to create an immersive experience.  

• What was the role of the virtual camera in your project, and how was it similar to and
different from the role of the camera in Assignment 1?

The virtual camera played a pivotal role in guiding the user's perspective and enhancing the immersive experience. Unlike in Assignment 1, where the camera was used for capturing specific angles in a 2D space, in this project, the virtual camera was dynamic and interactive, allowing users to explore the environment from various viewpoints. This interactivity was key to the user's experience of the 3D space.  


• How did you use sound in your project, and how was this similar to and different from your use of sound in Assignments 1 and 2?

Sound in the project was used to create atmosphere and emotional depth, similar to previous assignments but adapted for a 3D environment. Background music was chosen to evoke a sense of order and immersion, while ambient sounds like birds singing were used sparingly to avoid clutter and maintain a peaceful atmosphere. This approach differed from earlier projects where sound was more directly tied to visual transitions

• How did you unify the different elements of your virtual environment under a certain theme
or concept? How did your theme or concept evolve over the project’s development?

The theme of "Life and Death" was central to the project, guiding the design of the environment and the choice of symbols and colors. The environment evolved from initial sketches to a more refined concept that balanced fantasy and realism, inspired by games like "NieR: Automata" and "Graveyard Shift." This thematic consistency ensured a cohesive and engaging user experience.

• What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldn’t have
discovered otherwise?

Play testing uncovered issues that were not apparent during the design phase, such as navigation problems and model collisions. These insights were critical for making necessary adjustments, ensuring that the final environment was user-friendly and immersive. For instance, adjustments were made to pathways and colliders to prevent users from getting stuck or lost.  


## Statement Writing

**Assignment01**

"Void" is a multimedia project using video and sound. Inspired by personal experiences and the dragonfly symbol, it shows the transformation and cycles of life. I aimed to match ambient sounds with visuals to evoke deep emotions and guide viewers through a thoughtful narrative. The dragonfly, symbolizing change, plays a key role in connecting the themes of life and death, creating an immersive, emotional experience.

**Assignment02**

"Memory Icons" is a suite of digital icons for an iPhone app. The theme is memory, chosen to resonate with users who document their lives. The design process had many iterations to improve clarity and appeal. Using bright colors and familiar symbols, the icons aim to evoke personal history and nostalgia. The final designs translate abstract memory concepts into concrete visual elements, creating an engaging and cohesive user interface.

**Assignment03**

"Crosses" is an interactive 3D project. Inspired by games like "NieR: Automata," it balances realism and fantasy to explore themes of grief and the passage of time. The project uses spatial design, dynamic camera angles, and ambient soundscapes to engage users emotionally. Play testing was crucial, revealing insights that helped refine the user experience and solve navigation issues. This iterative process ensured a smooth and immersive final product. 

## overall structure plan

About the visual design for this website, I want the user to associate with  70's vintage style with it. In addition, the webpage should face to everyone who wants to know my art, it should be clear and understandable. 
  To achieve the style, about the colours, I will use colours with high contrast and grey hue, about the text I will use the texts with thick strokes and the font which looks round. 
  Webpage function plan is a vital part to make a webpage easy to visited. So, here are some functions I will try to  put into the webpage:
   *Information bar*
   *Menu*
   *Searching bar*
   *Page jumpping*

With these ideas, i started creating my first layout. Because the colours are not been chosen i use the black-grey hue to produce some pages i will use in my project.
